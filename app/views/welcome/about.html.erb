<div class="war">WE ARE A COUNTRY AT <span class="font-effect-fire-animation war2">WAR!</span><br></div>

<div class="about-text"><p>No, no... not with the refugees. No, not with the <span class="boldfire font-effect-fire">immigrants</span> either. Not even with the homosexuals... No, we're at war with <span class="boldfire font-effect-fire">fear</span>-mongering, hyperbole, and a <span class="bold">waning</span> interest in factual integrity. Who would have thought, in an era when the sum of human knowledge and understanding can be <span class="boldfire font-effect-fire">summoned</span> with a couple taps of the finger – thanks Mr. <span class="bold">Jobs!</span> – politicians, reporters, your drunk uncle and the like could get by professing completely unsubstantiated nonsense, with <span class="boldfire font-effect-fire">no </span>real purpose other than to <span class="boldfire font-effect-fire">anger</span> and distract?</p>

<p>Our <span class="bold">fight</span> is not easy, but I believe, with just a little reason and adherence to <span class="bold">truth</span>, we can begin to adjust the rhetoric and clear away the bullshit.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and remember: the world isn't <span class="bold">ending</span>. It's not the end of days.</p>
